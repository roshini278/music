Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. The common elements of music are pitch
(which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness),
and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound).
Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. 
Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, 
solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek μουσική 
(mousike; "art of the Muses").</p1>

<p2 style="font-family:comicsansms; color:white;">In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the creation of works of music 
(songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. 
Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. 
Common sayings such as "the harmony of the spheres" and "it is music to my ears" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to 
listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, 
"There is no noise, only sound."</p2>
